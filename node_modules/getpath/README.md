# getPath
> Kinda like `isSet` from that *other* language, but you get the value back too.

## What
`getPath` takes an object (or array), and a string representing the path to a key you want to find within it. If it exists you'll get the value back, and if it doesn't you'll just get `undefined`. When you can't guarantee a value exists within the object this saves you from testing at every level.

In other words,
```javascript
let myValue = 'default';

if (myObject && myObject.maybe && myObject.maybe[1] && myObject.maybe[1].maybeNot) {
	myValue = myObject.maybe[1].maybeNot;
}
```
becomes
```javascript
const myValue = getPath(myObject, 'maybe[1].maybeNot') || 'default';
```

## How
`getPath` takes two arguments - the object you want to find something within, and the path to what you want as a string.
The path can include dot-notation and array indices.

If you have an object called `a` and want to use the value of `a.b[1].c` *if it exists*, just call `getPath(a, 'b[1].c')`. If that exists, you'll get it, and if any part of that path doesn't exist you'll just get `undefined`. Easy!
